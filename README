(1) This folder contains some of the code for CS 395T scalable machine learning class in UT Austin.
(2) Project Description:
hw2: Parallel Matrix Multiplication, Alternating Least Squares using OpenMP. 
hw3: Parallel Coordinate Descent in SVM using OpenMP with and with atomic locks.
hw4: Parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication using OpenMP, and use it in Eigenvector centrality.
hw5: Parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication using Galois, and use it in PageRank.
hw6: Compute TF-IDF value on web documents using MapReduce on Hadoop file system, and cluster them using Batch k-means, Incremental k-means, and LIBLINEAR SVM.
hw7: Compare PageRank using OpenMP, GraphLab, Apache Spark, Apache Mahout, and Galois. Compare Alternating Least Squares on Apache Mahout, and Apache Spark. Parallel Hessian-vector product using OpenMP.
